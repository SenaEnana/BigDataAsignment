## Data analysis process on google colab
### First Step Questions:
#### Cancellation Analysis

What is the overall cancellation rate in the dataset?<br>
How does the cancellation rate vary across different hotels? <br>
Are there any patterns or trends in cancellations over the years or months? <br>
#### Lead Time Analysis

How does the lead time (time between booking and arrival) influence cancellations? <br>
Is there a correlation between lead time and the type of room booked? <br>
#### Guest Demographics

What is the distribution of adults, children, and babies in the dataset? <br>
How does the composition of guests vary across different countries? <br>
#### Booking Patterns

What is the distribution of stays in weekend nights and stays in week nights? <br>
Are there certain months or weeks that are more popular for bookings? <br>
#### Meal and Parking Preferences

What are the preferred meal types among guests? <br>
How does the requirement for car parking spaces vary among different customer types? <br>
#### Special Requests and Changes

What is the frequency of special requests by guests? <br>
How often do guests make changes to their bookings, and what types of changes are common? <br>
These questions provide a starting point for the analysis. Please let me know if you have specific areas of interest or if you would like to prioritize any particular questions. <br> Additionally, feel free to add or modify questions based on your specific goals for the analysis.

### Third Step
In this step, we will draw conclusions and prediction

#### 1. Cancellation Rate Analysis:
###### Overall Cancellation Rate:
The overall cancellation rate is X%. <br>
Cancellation Rate by Hotel: <br>
Hotel A has a higher/lower cancellation rate compared to Hotel B. <br>

###### Cancellation Rate Over Time: <br>
There is a trend of increasing/decreasing cancellation rates over the months/years. <br>

#### 2. Lead Time Analysis:
##### Distribution of Lead Time:
The majority of bookings have a lead time of X days.

##### Lead Time vs. Cancellation:
Bookings with longer lead times tend to have a higher/lower cancellation rate.

#### 3. Guest Demographics:
##### Distribution of Adults, Children, Babies:
Most bookings are for X adults, Y children, and Z babies. <br>

##### Composition of Guests by Country: 
Guests are predominantly from the top 3-5 countries, with Country X having the highest number of guests. <br>

#### 4. Booking Patterns:
##### Distribution of Stays:
The majority of bookings involve X nights for weekend stays and Y nights for week stays.<br>

##### Popular Months for Bookings:
Bookings are highest in Month X and lowest in Month Y. <br>

#### 5. Meal and Parking Preferences:
##### Meal Preference:
Guests prefer Meal Type X, and it may be associated with a higher/lower cancellation rate.<br>

##### Car Parking Preference:
Most guests do/do not require car parking spaces, and it may influence the cancellation rate. <br>

#### 6. Special Requests and Changes:
##### Distribution of Special Requests:
Guests frequently make X special requests, and it may impact the cancellation rate. <br>

##### Booking Changes vs. Cancellation:
Bookings with more/fewer changes tend to have a higher/lower cancellation rate. <br>

### Predictions:
Based on the observed patterns, we might consider the following predictions: <br>
Predict the likelihood of cancellation for new bookings based on lead time, booking changes, and other relevant factors. <br>
Identify high-risk periods or months with increased cancellation rates for proactive management. <br>
Build predictive models to forecast the cancellation rate for specific customer segments or hotels. <br>
